- I love to sail and swim
- I am adventurous, like to try new things, and passionate about traveling 
- I love spending time with my family and friends
- I am interested in working as either a Business Analyst, Systems Analyst, or a Project Manager
- I also have thoughts of working in SAP, UX/UI Design, or in Customer Experience

## Technical Background 
I have completed three internships in Information Systems. My first internship was in Customer Experience. In my second internship, I was considered a Business Analyst. In my last internship, I was on the Manufacturing IT team. With each internship, I worked with applications such as Jira, Confluence, Power BI, and SharePoint. Outside of my internship/work experience, most of my technical experience has come from taking various undergrad and graduate level courses. I am familiar with languages such as Java, JavaScript, React, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, PHP, and Ruby. I have never used these programming languages outside of the courses given at Grand Valley.
