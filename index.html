                <h2> Technical Experience</h2>
                <p>I have completed three internships in Information Systems. My first internship was in Customer Experience. In my second internship, I was considered a Business Analyst. In my last internship, I was on the Manufacturing IT team. With each internship, I worked with applications such as Jira, Confluence, Power BI, and SharePoint. Outside of my internship/work experience, most of my technical experience has come from taking various undergrad and graduate level courses. I am familiar with languages such as Java, JavaScript, React, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, PHP, and Ruby. I have never used these programming languages outside of the courses given at Grand Valley. </p>
