                        <p> Fun Fact About Swimming: I learned how to swim at a very young age. I loved playing in the water so I joined a summer swim club. I raced against other people for about 2 in a half years before swimming in highschool. I joined the Varsity Swim Team my freshman year. My senior year, my best friend and I, were the captians of the swim team. I accomplished and beat many of my goals.</p>
                        
                        <p> Fun Fact About Sailing: I have been a certified sailor since 2018. I joined a sailing program when I was 13 and learned how to sail on the Detroit River. I loved the program so much that I became an assistant instructor and worked to obtain my sailing license. This program allowed me teach other children about sailing and strengthen my leadership skills. </p>
                        
                        <p>The best part about sailing, for me, is when it is a calm summer day. When the wind and waves are calm, I love to listen to music. I normally bring my speaker and snacks out on the boat with me. On calm days, I love to listen to upbeat music that gets the other kids and myself in a good mood. This is an example of a song I might play. </p>
