						<h2> Team Project: Lakeshore Misfits </h2>
						<p>Have you ever wanted to create a website that incorporated different color schemes? We are creating a website where a user can generate a new color pallete and copy the color values. One feature our website has, that is different from others, is the the color contrast checker. It is important to make sure users are creating website that are compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. We have included a feature that will let a user know if the colors generated are either Level A, AA, or AAA, according to WCAG 2.0. </p>
